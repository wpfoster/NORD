			My name is William Foster. I am like any other man, only more so. 
			I work for a pharmaceutical group purchasing and contract managment organization 
			that offers a variety of services and benefits to closed door pharmacies. 
			I monitor contract compliance and interact with pharmacies and wholesalers 
			to resolve pricing and contract discrepancies. I have also taken on a role in 
			the mangement of purchase data. These new responsibilities entail obtaining 
			data from wholesalers and ingesting it into our database while checking for 
			errors. I also synthesize invoices for quarterly incentives and interact with 
			pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure these rebates are paid.
